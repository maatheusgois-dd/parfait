<p align="center"><em>Layered meeting notes. Perfectly local.</em></p>

<p align="center">
An open-source, on-device meeting notetaker for macOS — a lightweight alternative to Granola.<br>
It lives in your menu bar, notices when a meeting starts, records both sides of the call,<br>
and writes a transcript with named speakers plus templated notes — without audio ever leaving your Mac.<br>
Then it hands any meeting to <strong>Claude</strong> through a built-in MCP server — one call, your whole
history, or the meeting happening <em>right now</em> — with nothing uploaded.

## What it does

- **Auto-detects meetings.** When Zoom, Meet, Teams, FaceTime — anything — starts using your
  microphone, Parfait offers to record (or just starts, if you tell it to). Manual recording is
  one click in the menu bar.
- **Records both sides.** Your mic through AVAudioEngine; everyone else through a Core Audio
  process tap on system audio. No virtual audio drivers, no kernel extensions, no bots joining
  your calls.
- **Transcribes on device** with Apple's SpeechAnalyzer (the macOS 26 speech engine) — with
  per-segment timestamps.
- **Names the speakers.** You're "you" (mic channel); remote voices are separated with a small
  on-device diarization model ([FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio), ~22 MB,
  downloaded once). Calendar attendees are offered as rename suggestions, and renaming a speaker
  fixes the whole transcript.
- **Summarizes on device** with Apple Intelligence (FoundationModels), following **your**
  editable markdown templates. Long meetings map-reduce through the model; meetings too big for
  it route to your own Claude account.
- **Everything is editable** — title, notes, transcript, speakers.
- **Ask Claude live, mid-meeting.** A floating card shows the transcript as it happens; one button
  opens Claude on the call in progress. Parfait exposes the running transcript through a
  `get_live_transcript` MCP tool, so Claude can answer "what did I miss?" or "what should I ask
  next?" — no pasting, and it rides over full-screen Zoom.
- **Chat with one meeting, natively in Claude.** Your own question (or the "Ask about this meeting"
  screen) opens Claude Desktop with that meeting loaded through Parfait's MCP connector — Claude
  reads it itself; nothing is copied in.
- **Chat with *all* your meetings.** "Ask your meetings" points Claude at your whole library the
  same way. Because Parfait ships an MCP server over your meetings, once it's connected you can skip
  the app entirely and just ask Claude — Code or Desktop — anytime. Claude can even regenerate a
  meeting's notes against a different template, or edit them, through the same server.
- **Publish** a beautiful self-contained page (notes + transcript) as a secret gist on your own
  GitHub (`gh`), with a rendered **notes.parfait.to** URL to share — Parfait's own CDN serving
  your gist back rendered, not a raw-file host — or preview/export the HTML locally with no
  dependencies at all.
- **Plain files, no database.** Every meeting is a folder of JSON + Markdown + m4a in
  `~/Library/Application Support/Parfait`. Your data is greppable, backupable, yours.

## The stack is the feature

Parfait has no backend, no accounts, and no API keys. It composes things your Mac already has:

| Need | Provider |
|---|---|
| Meeting detection | Core Audio process objects (mic-in-use by other apps) |
| System-audio capture | Core Audio process taps (macOS 14.4+) |
| Transcription | SpeechAnalyzer / SpeechTranscriber (macOS 26, on device) |
| Speaker separation | FluidAudio CoreML diarization (on device) |
| Summaries, titles | Apple Intelligence FoundationModels (on device) |
| Long meetings, publishing | **Your own** Claude account via the `claude` CLI |
| Chat (per-meeting and cross-meeting) | **Your own** Claude Desktop, via a deep link + Parfait's MCP connector |
| Publish target | **Your own** GitHub via `gh` (secret gist), served back rendered by **notes.parfait.to** (Parfait's own CDN in front of your gist), or a local browser preview / HTML export |

## Requirements

- **macOS 26 (Tahoe)** on Apple Silicon
- **Apple Intelligence enabled** (Settings → Apple Intelligence & Siri) for on-device summaries
- **Required for chat:** [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), with the parfait MCP
  connector added (Settings → Connect Claude) — the Chat and "Ask your meetings" screens open
  a pre-filled prompt there
- Optional: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (`claude` CLI, logged in) — unlocks
  long-meeting summaries, billed to your own plan
- Optional: [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh auth login`) — to publish a shareable rendered
  URL as a gist on your own account (without it, you can still preview and export the HTML locally)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conrad-vanl/parfait.git
cd parfait
make install        # builds, assembles Parfait.app, copies to /Applications
open /Applications/Parfait.app
```

Look for the parfait glass in your menu bar. On first recording, macOS will ask for
**Microphone** and **System Audio Recording** permission (the latter lives under
Privacy & Security → Screen & System Audio Recording → "System Audio Recording Only").

> **Signing note:** `make install` ad-hoc signs with a stable designated requirement, so TCC
> permissions survive rebuilds. If you have an Apple Development certificate, prefer
> `make install SIGN_ID="Apple Development: you@example.com (TEAMID)"`.

## Connect Claude to your meeting library

```bash
claude mcp add parfait -s user -- "/Applications/Parfait.app/Contents/MacOS/Parfait" --mcp
```

Then from any `claude` session (or Claude Desktop with the same server):

> "Search my meetings for when I last discussed hiring, and summarize what was decided."

The MCP server (`Parfait --mcp`) speaks stdio over your on-disk library. Read tools:
`list_meetings`, `search_meetings`, `get_meeting`, `get_transcript`, and `get_live_transcript`
(the meeting in progress). Edit tools: `regenerate_summary`, `update_summary`, and the template
tools (`list_templates`, `get_template`, `create_template`, `update_template`, `rename_template`,
`delete_template`). Nothing leaves your Mac except what the model reads or writes through them.

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop reads MCP servers from a config file, not a CLI command. Open (or create)
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` and merge this into the
`mcpServers` object — **don't overwrite the file** if you already have other servers configured:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "parfait": {
      "command": "/Applications/Parfait.app/Contents/MacOS/Parfait",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving. Settings → "Connect Claude to your meetings" in the app
has a "Copy JSON" button that fills in your actual install path, and a "Reveal in Finder" button
that jumps straight to the config file.

## Templates

Notes are shaped by markdown templates you can edit in **Settings → Templates** (or any editor —
they're just files in `~/Library/Application Support/Parfait/Templates/`). Headings guide the
model; prose under a heading tells it what belongs there. Placeholders: `{{title}}`, `{{date}}`,
`{{attendees}}`, `{{duration}}`, `{{app}}`. Ships with **Meeting Notes**, **1-on-1**, and
**Interview**.

## Privacy model

- Audio, transcripts, and notes never leave your Mac by default.
- The only network calls Parfait itself makes: one-time model downloads (Apple speech assets via
  the OS; the diarization model from Hugging Face).
- Anything involving Claude or GitHub happens through **your** already-authenticated CLIs, at
  your explicit request (chat, publish, or when a meeting exceeds the on-device model), on your
  own accounts.
- Publishing is always an explicit action. "Secret" gists are unlisted (on your own account,
  deletable) — anyone with the link can view the page; the browser preview and HTML export never
  leave your Mac. Deleting the gist stops new visits, but the rendered link is cached at the
  edge and in browsers, so it can keep serving for up to about a day after deletion.

## Development

```bash
swift build          # debug build
swift test           # 102 unit tests (store, labeling, formatting, templates, MCP, HTML, live transcription, Claude deep-links, CLI args)
make app             # assemble dist/Parfait.app
make icon            # regenerate the icon from scripts/MakeIcon.swift
```

The audio/ML paths need live permissions no CI box has; they're covered by the manual checklist
in [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md). Architecture and design decisions live in
[docs/superpowers/specs/](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-parfait-design.md).
