<p align="center"><em>Layered meeting notes. Perfectly local.</em></p>

<p align="center">
An open-source, on-device meeting notetaker for macOS — a lightweight alternative to Granola.<br>
It lives in your menu bar, notices when a meeting starts, records both sides of the call,<br>
and writes a transcript with named speakers plus templated notes — without audio ever leaving your Mac.<br>
Then it hands any meeting to <strong>your assistant</strong> — Apple Intelligence, Claude, or Codex — through a
built-in MCP server: one call, your whole history, or the meeting happening <em>right now</em>, with nothing uploaded.

## What it does

- **Auto-detects meetings.** When Zoom, Meet, Teams, FaceTime — anything — starts using your
  microphone, Nutola offers to record (or just starts, if you tell it to). Manual recording is
  one click in the menu bar.
- **Records both sides.** Your mic through AVAudioEngine; everyone else through a Core Audio
  process tap on system audio. No virtual audio drivers, no kernel extensions, no bots joining
  your calls.
- **Transcribes on device** with Apple's SpeechAnalyzer (the macOS 26 speech engine) — with
  per-segment timestamps.
- **Names the speakers.** You're "you" (mic channel); remote voices are separated with a small
  on-device diarization model ([FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio), ~22 MB,
  downloaded once). Calendar attendees are offered as rename suggestions, and renaming a speaker
  fixes the whole transcript.
- **Summarizes on device** with Apple Intelligence (FoundationModels), following **your**
  editable markdown templates. Long meetings map-reduce through the model; meetings too big for
  it route to your own Claude or Codex account.
- **Drafts notes live.** While a meeting is still recording, Nutola streams a first-pass summary
  from the live transcript so notes appear within seconds — then refines them after the call ends.
- **Everything is editable** — title, notes, transcript, speakers, with full edit history.
- **Calendar-aware.** With Calendar access, **Coming up** shows your agenda, pre-fills titles and
  attendees when you record, and offers one-click join links (Zoom, Meet, Teams, Webex). A menu-bar
  countdown can remind you before the next event.
- **Folders for recurring meetings.** Group standups, 1:1s, and project syncs into folders. Assign
  from the sidebar, drag-and-drop, or **Add to folder** on an upcoming event — future recordings
  with the same calendar title land in the same folder automatically.
- **Ask live, mid-meeting.** A floating card shows the transcript as it happens; one button opens
  your assistant on the call in progress. Nutola exposes the running transcript through a
  `get_live_transcript` MCP tool, so you can ask "what did I miss?" or "what should I ask next?"
  — no pasting, and it rides over full-screen Zoom.
- **Ask about one meeting or all of them.** The **Ask** screen answers in-app (Apple Intelligence)
  or opens Claude / Codex with your meeting library loaded through Nutola's MCP connector — nothing
  is copied in. Once connected, you can skip the app entirely and just ask your assistant anytime.
- **Regenerate and edit notes through MCP.** Claude or Codex can regenerate a meeting's notes against
  a different template, or edit them directly, through the same server.
- **Publish** a beautiful self-contained page (notes + transcript) as a secret gist on your own
  GitHub (`gh`), with a rendered share URL served back by the bundled notes-proxy worker — or
  preview/export the HTML locally with no dependencies at all.
- **Crash diagnostics (opt-in).** When enabled, Nutola records a scrubbed crash report (never audio,
  transcript, or notes) on both uncaught exceptions and fatal signals, kept as a capped history and
  viewable in Settings → Debug → Crash history.
- **Plain files, no database.** Every meeting is a folder of JSON + Markdown + m4a in
  `~/Library/Application Support/Nutola`. Your data is greppable, backupable, yours.

## The stack is the feature

Nutola has no backend, no accounts, and no API keys. It composes things your Mac already has:

| Need | Provider |
|---|---|
| Meeting detection | Core Audio process objects (mic-in-use by other apps) |
| System-audio capture | Core Audio process taps (macOS 14.4+) |
| Transcription | SpeechAnalyzer / SpeechTranscriber (macOS 26, on device) |
| Speaker separation | FluidAudio CoreML diarization (on device) |
| Summaries, titles | Apple Intelligence FoundationModels (on device) |
| Long meetings, publishing | **Your own** Claude or Codex account via the `claude` / `codex` CLI |
| Ask (per-meeting, cross-meeting, live) | **Apple Intelligence** in-app, or **your own** Claude / Codex (CLI or desktop app) via Nutola's MCP connector |
| Calendar | EventKit (on device) |
| Publish target | **Your own** GitHub via `gh` (secret gist), served back rendered by the bundled notes-proxy worker, or a local browser preview / HTML export |

## Requirements

- **macOS 26 (Tahoe)** on Apple Silicon
- **Apple Intelligence enabled** (Settings → Apple Intelligence & Siri) for on-device summaries
  and in-app Ask
- **Optional — Claude:** [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or
  [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (`claude` CLI, logged in) — for cloud Ask and
  long-meeting summaries, billed to your own plan
- **Optional — Codex:** [Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex) (`codex` CLI, logged in) — same as
  Claude, through your own account
- **Optional:** [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh auth login`) — to publish a shareable
  rendered URL as a gist on your own account (without it, you can still preview and export the
  HTML locally)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matheusgois-dd/Nutola.git
cd nutola
make install        # builds, assembles Nutola.app, copies to /Applications
open /Applications/Nutola.app
```

Look for the nutola glass in your menu bar. A first-run onboarding walkthrough covers permissions
and optional setup. On first recording, macOS will ask for **Microphone** and **System Audio
Recording** permission (the latter lives under Privacy & Security → Screen & System Audio
Recording → "System Audio Recording Only").

> **Signing note:** `make install` ad-hoc signs with a stable designated requirement, so TCC
> permissions survive rebuilds. If you have an Apple Development certificate, prefer
> `make install SIGN_ID="Apple Development: you@example.com (TEAMID)"`.

## Connect your assistant to your meeting library

Pick your assistant in **Settings → Intelligence**. For Claude or Codex, add the Nutola MCP
connector once — the app has one-click setup buttons, or run it yourself:

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add nutola -s user -- "/Applications/Nutola.app/Contents/MacOS/Nutola" --mcp
```

### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add nutola -- "/Applications/Nutola.app/Contents/MacOS/Nutola" --mcp
```

Then from any session (or the desktop app with the same server):

> "Search my meetings for when I last discussed hiring, and summarize what was decided."

The MCP server (`Nutola --mcp`) speaks stdio over your on-disk library. Read tools:
`list_meetings` (paginated via `limit`/`offset`), `search_meetings` (paginated),
`get_meeting`, `get_transcript`, and `get_live_transcript`
(the meeting in progress). Edit tools: `regenerate_summary`, `update_summary`,
`delete_meeting`, and the template
tools (`list_templates`, `get_template`, `create_template`, `update_template`, `rename_template`,
`delete_template`). Nothing leaves your Mac except what the model reads or writes through them.

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop reads MCP servers from a config file, not a CLI command. Open (or create)
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` and merge this into the
`mcpServers` object — **don't overwrite the file** if you already have other servers configured:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nutola": {
      "command": "/Applications/Nutola.app/Contents/MacOS/Nutola",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving. Settings → Intelligence has "Add to Claude Code" and
"Add to Claude Desktop" buttons, plus "Copy JSON" and "Reveal in Finder" for manual setup.

### Codex

Codex stores MCP servers in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Settings → Intelligence has an "Add with
Codex" button, or run the `codex mcp add` command above. Use `$nutola` (not `@`) to attach
the connector in Codex prompts.

## Templates

Notes are shaped by markdown templates you can edit in **Settings → Templates** (or any editor —
they're just files in `~/Library/Application Support/Nutola/Templates/`). Headings guide the
model; prose under a heading tells it what belongs there. Placeholders: `{{title}}`, `{{date}}`,
`{{attendees}}`, `{{duration}}`, `{{app}}`. Ships with **Meeting Notes**, **1-on-1**, and
**Interview**.

## Privacy model

- Audio, transcripts, and notes never leave your Mac by default.
- The only network calls Nutola itself makes: one-time model downloads (Apple speech assets via
  the OS; the diarization model from Hugging Face).
- Anything involving Claude, Codex, or GitHub happens through **your** already-authenticated
  CLIs, at your explicit request (chat, publish, or when a meeting exceeds the on-device model),
  on your own accounts.
- Publishing is always an explicit action. "Secret" gists are unlisted (on your own account,
  deletable) — anyone with the link can view the page; the browser preview and HTML export never
  leave your Mac.

## Development
