// MARK: - #87: MenuBarTitleTruncator

/// `MenuBarTitleTruncator.label(for:)` renders the menu-bar slot text for an
/// upcoming event: a (possibly truncated) title followed by a separator +
/// countdown suffix. The title is truncated with a ".." ellipsis when it
/// exceeds the per-slot width budget so the menu-bar item never overflows.
///
/// These tests pin the public `label(for:)` contract:
///   - long titles are truncated and end with the ".." ellipsis
///   - short titles pass through unchanged (suffix still appended)
///   - the title budget never collapses to zero (clamped to a minimum), so a
///     very long countdown can't starve the title to an empty string
